Dna sequencer, CodeCademy project

For a DNA strand to be a protein, it has to satisfy these 3 conditions:
  1. The beginning of the strand has to be 'ATG'
  2. The end of the strand has to be 'TGA'
  3. The number of nucleotides in between the beginning of the strand and the end of the strand has to be a multiple of 3.
